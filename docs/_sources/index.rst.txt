Astro-Atmos Documentation
=========================

Tools to make local weather forecasts for terrestrial astronomical observations.


Note: Because of the models/data sources currently implemented, this can only forecast locations within the United States. I have partially developed support for Canada too, but it is currently incomplete.

Code documentation is found here. For a more general overview and installation instructions check out the `Github page. <https://github.com/klarrieu/astro-atmos>`_
